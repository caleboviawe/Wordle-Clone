# Wordle-Clone

## Date Completed 
February 2023

## Description
I leveraged what I learned in my second year Full-Stack Development course to make a web-based application meticulously crafted after the immensely popular game 'Wordle'. This clone faithfully recreates the addictive word-guessing experience using a combination of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
